        <h2>1. No Information Collection</h2>
        <p>Block Blast Pro ("the App") is designed to respect your privacy. **We do not collect, store, or share any personal information or device data.** This includes but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal identifiers (e.g., name, email address)</li>
            <li>Device information (e.g., model, serial number)</li>
            <li>Usage data (e.g., gameplay statistics, session duration)</li>
            <li>Location data or sensor information</li>
            <li>Any other form of data associated with you or your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any information, there is no data to use, share, or analyze. The App operates entirely locally on your device, and all gameplay data is stored solely for the purpose of enabling the App’s functionality (e.g., saving game progress). This data is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party services, advertising networks, or analytics tools. Therefore, there are no third parties collecting data through the App.</p>

        <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Block Blast Pro is intended for users of all ages. However, we remind parents and guardians to supervise children’s use of digital apps as appropriate. As we do not collect any information, this policy applies equally to all users.</p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>While we do not handle personal data, we take technical measures to ensure the App’s integrity and security. All local data storage is encrypted and restricted to your device.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated above. We reserve the right to update or modify this policy in the future. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the effective date at the top of this page.</p>
