<h1>Privacy Policy for Mahjong Majong</h1>
<p>Effective Date: 2025-05-25</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how GlendGame ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares personal information in connection with the Mahjong Majong application (the "App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information.</p>
<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>We want to emphasize that the Mahjong Majong App does not collect any personal information from you. This includes but is not limited to your name, address, email address, phone number, location data, social media profiles, or any other identifiable information. We have designed the App in such a way that it operates without the need to gather such data to provide you with an enjoyable gaming experience.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App may utilize certain third-party services, such as advertising platforms or analytics tools, to support its functionality. However, we have ensured that these third-party services are also configured not to collect any personal information from users of our App. We work with these providers to make sure that your privacy is maintained throughout your interaction with the App.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Although we do not collect personal information, we take reasonable security measures to safeguard the integrity and availability of the App itself. We implement industry-standard security practices to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the App's code and any associated data that is not personal information.</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The Mahjong Majong App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take prompt steps to delete that information.</p>
<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes, we will post the updated Privacy Policy within the App or through other appropriate means and indicate the effective date of the new version. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our privacy practices.</p>
